## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
  Clue holdtone is halved

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[N/A]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[It took a while for me to understand how some of the more complicated functions worked, such as the sound synthesis functions. In addition, I forgot about some of the global variables that help me 
 keep track of the game, so I was stuck on the guess function for a bit. Otherwise, there weren't any times when I felt majorly challenged since the instructions were very clear and intuiitive.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Is there a way to make it so that buttons and text have a size that is set to the user's browser size so that it changes based on the size of the browser? I think this would make game design much nicer, since having 4 buttons in a square would be better than having 4 buttons aligned vertically]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would definetly start by making the sequence random each time and making different levels that vary in length and speed. After that, I would probably look to add more colors to the game, add different modes like an endless mode, and making the web design look better overall]
